A cute little app to tell someone you just got home. Steps to get it working:

1. Sign up for an account at [Pushover]('https://www.pushover.net/') and create an application.
2. Add the User ID and Application token.
3. Give your phone a static IP on your home router and add it to the config.
4. Run it!
